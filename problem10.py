Answer.....

Break statement break the loop and get outside the loop as soon as it encounter break in the 
loop of a program.
eg.
for i in range(1,10):
    if i == 5:
        break  # this will break the loop and loop will stop when if condition is met.

While continue statement tell the loop to continue if it encounter continue in the loop of a 
program.
eg.
for i in range(1,10):
    if i == 5:
        continue  # this will continue the loop means the loop will not go ahead in the program
                    and loop will continue if the given condiution is met.
