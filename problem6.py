Answer.....

During assigning a value to a variable we use assignment operators which is single equal sign =
but when we use equal to in an epression we use double equal to sign ==

eg- 

a = 5  #assignment operator
b = 6 #assignment operator
if (a==b) #equality operator
  print ("a and b are equal")
